Elementor for WooCommerce. This plugin adds product templates to create custom product pages as well as allows for full Elementor page builder editing inside the product itself.

== Description ==

Build custom layouts for your products in WooCommerce using the amazing Elementor page building experience. You can work inside one product or build templates that you can assign to multiple products.

When working in Elementor there are 16 widgets that each add a different part of your product page. Things like the product title and the add to cart button. Within each widget, there are style settings that allow you to control fonts, colors, alignments, backgrounds, etc. This enables you to make custom designed product pages where you control the layout and style of each section.
